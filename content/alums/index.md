# Alumni

Hello alumni. We hope you'll stay connected to the students of the Math Department to help students learn more about careers after undergraduate studies.

There are a couple student groups, us and MATRIX, who serve as the social clubs for those interested in mathematics and associated fields.
SIGma, while focusing more on topics in computer science, hosts a \#careers channel in our [[Discord](https://www.cstheory.org/discord)] where alums can be particularly helpful in reporting back "from the field" about good career options for math majors, and what classes are most useful in them.
See [[Matrix](https://discord.gg/WrVETynfWx)] and the [[Math Department](https://forms.illinois.edu/sec/1809202407)] as well.

Let these groups be a long-term connection to students past and future, and look in occasionally to join the discussion and stay in touch with old friends.
