# About

### What is SIGma

We are the Special Interest Group for math and algorithms at UIUC. 
This is the place to learn about theoretical computer science and meet people who are also interested. 
We hold weekly meetings covering a different topic broadly relating to some central theme for the semester. 
This club is just as much for those who are new to pure mathematics and theoretical computer science as well as those who already have a deep interested.
The only prerequisite is an interest in learning math and theory.
Check out our past [[meetings](https://www.cstheory.org/meetings/)] to see all the stuff we've been up to!

### When and Where?
