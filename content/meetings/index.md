# Meetings

This is where we publish all of our weekly content, along with any other related material. These will be listed in reverse chronological order. If there is anything missing, let us know.

## Fall 2023

This semester's theme will be about all things related to coding theory! This can range from sphere packing, complexity, error correcting codes, and more.

## Spring 2023

This semester, we ran meetings about combinational structures and algorithms. Much of the material is being based out of Donald Knuth's "The Art of Computer of Computer Programming" Volumes 4A and 4B. We will also probably look into other sources as the field is quite vast.
