## Spring 2023

This semester, we are running meetings about combinatorial structures and algorithms. Much of the material is being based out of Donald Knuth's "The Art of Computer of Computer Programming" Volumes 4A and 4B. We will also probably look into other sources as the field is quite vast.

## Fall 2022

This semester was our first semester! As such, we decided to start with some more introductory material. The material was loosely based on Michael Sipser's "Introduction to the Theory of Computation"
